Oh yeah, yeah, come on

You think you're quick
But I'd like to see you keep up with me
You think you're slick
But I'd like to see you pull a trick on me
You think you're so cool
Hey big man you're old school
You think you're smart
But who the hell d'ya think you're talkin to
Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself
Tell me why keep on denying
Everything you say (denying)
Everything you do
So be a fool to yourself forever more (trying)
Any kind of move (tell me)
So what's if gonna prove
You ain't fooling nobody
You ain't fooling nobody
But yourself
I know you're sweet
But I know you don't want to be seen that way
Admit defeat, win or lose
Who cares it's just a game you play
I know you need me
If you stay that way it's never gonna be
You've got your style
But I know what you really want from me
Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself
Tell me why keep on denying

[Chorus]

Check yourself, but don't forget yourself
Coz you're denying,
(Ha ha - check - ha)
Check yourself, but don't forget yourself
(You're getting everything you are and even everything you need)
That's life - so just check yourself Everyone can see who you are
Take a look at yourself Tell me why you keel denying

[Chorus]
